# GDSC-FRONTEND-Task

Created a web application to display the top 5 artist and songs of a given country using last.fm API.

Deployed on Render: https://musically-9y54.onrender.com

Next, I would really like to add a graphical world map to point out the country and display the artist and songs as a pop up.
